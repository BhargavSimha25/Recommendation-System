# Recommendation Systems in Machine Learning 📈

Welcome to the **Recommendation Systems in Machine Learning** repository! This project focuses on understanding, building, and implementing various types of recommendation systems. Recommendation systems are essential for providing personalized experiences in many industries, including e-commerce, streaming services, and social media platforms.

## 📚 Overview

Recommendation systems leverage user behavior, preferences, and interactions to suggest relevant items, products, or content. By using techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods, these systems can tailor recommendations to individual users, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.
